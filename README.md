# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Hospitality Domain

## Project Overview
This project focuses on exploring and analyzing a dataset to generate actionable insights. The workflow includes **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **data cleaning and transformation**, and **ad-hoc reporting**
based on specific questions provided.

The goal is to understand the data, prepare it for analysis, and deliver reports that answer business questions in a clear and structured manner.

### Notebook Workflow
The main notebook, `EDA_and_Adhoc_Analysis.ipynb`, follows this workflow:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Importing and inspecting the data
   - Identifying missing, inconsistent, or faulty data
   - Visualizing trends, distributions, and relationships

2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**
   - Handling missing values and outliers
   - Transforming data into a suitable format for analysis
   - Creating derived variables where necessary

3. **Ad-hoc Analysis & Report Generation**
   - Answering specific questions provided by stakeholders
   - Generating tables, charts, and insights for each request
   - Exporting results as CSV and Excel reports for further use

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Open `EDA_and_Adhoc_Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Follow the notebook sequentially to replicate the analysis and generate reports.

## Notes
- The project is modular: datasets, notebook, and reports are separated for clarity.
- All intermediate and final results are saved in the `reports/` folder.
- Visualizations are included in the notebook to provide clear insights.
